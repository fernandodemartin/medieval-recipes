        <h2>Description</h2>
        <em><p>How to butter a Colle-flowre: Take a ripe Colle-flowre and cut off the buddes, boyle them in milke with a little Mace while they be very tender, then poure them into a Cullender, and let the Milke runne cleane from them, then take a ladle full of Creame, being boyled with a little whole mace, putting to it a ladle-full of thicke butter, mingle them together with a little Sugar, dish up your flowres upon sippets, poure your butter and creame hot upon it strowing on a little slict Nutmeg and salt, and serve it hot to the table.</em> (MS. Harleian 279, Leche Vyandez, 35).</p>
        <p>Although this is technically a seventeenth century recipe, the ingredients and methods were available in the sixteenth century, so this recipe would not be out of place at a late Elizabethan feast. Cauliflowers were introduced to England in the late sixteenth century (Brears, 2016, 288), and would have been seen as a novelty.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 head cauliflower</li>
            <li>500 mL milk</li>
            <li>150 mL cream</li>
            <li>50 g butter</li>
            <li>1 tsp powdered mace</li>
            <li>2 tbs sugar</li>
            <li>½ tsp nutmeg</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Break the cauliflower into florets.</li>
            <li>Cook until the cauliflower is soft, but still a bit crisp in the middle.</li>
            <li>DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE MILK OR IT WILL BOIL OVER AND MAKE A TERRIBLE MESS.</li>
            <li>To make the sauce, heat the cream, butter and sugar, stirring well to melt the butter and dissolve the sugar. Don’t let it boil, or the cream will curdle.</li>
            <li>DO NOT TAKE YOUR EYES OFF THE CREAM MIX OR IT WILL BOIL OVER AND MAKE A TERRIBLE MESS.</li>
            <li>To serve, pour the sauce over the cauliflower, and sprinkle with nutmeg and salt.</li>
        </ol>
