        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p></p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 ml honey</li>
            <li>500 g bread crumbs (approx)</li>
            <li>½ tbsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>Pinch saffron</li>
            <li>1 tbs fresh or powdered ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>½ tsp sandalwood (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Garnish:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Whole cloves</li>
                <li>Branches from a box tree</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the honey to a boil and skim off any scum.</li>
            <li>Keeping the pan over very low heat, add the spices except the cinnamon, and sandalwood if using, adjusting the quantities to suit your taste.</li>
            <li>Slowly beat in the bread crumbs. Add just enough bread crumbs to achieve a thick, stiff, well-blended mass You will know you have enough bread crumbs when the mix becomes hard to stir; this may take more or less bread crumbs than the amount specified.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and turn the mixture onto a lightly greased shallow baking tray. Press the gingerbread evenly out into the pan.</li>
            <li>Leave to cool in the fridge. When cool, sprinkle with cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Gently ease the ginger bread out of the tray, and cut into small squares.</li>
            <li>To serve, garnish with sprigs of box, and whole cloves.</li>
        </ol>
