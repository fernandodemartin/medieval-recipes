        <h2>Description</h2>
        <em><p>Gyngerbrede: Take a quart of hony, & sethe it, & skeme it clene; take Safroun, pouder Pepir, & throw ther-on; take grayted Bred, & make it so chargeaunt that it wol be y-lechyd; then take pouder Canelle, & straw ther-on y-now; then make yt square, lyke as thou wolt leche yt; take when thou lechyst hyt, an caste Box leves a-bouyn, y-stykyd ther-on, on clowys. And if thou wolt haue it Red, coloure it with Saunderys y-now.</em> (MS. Harleian 279, Leche Vyandez, 35).</p>
        <p>Gyngerbrede is a very well known recipe from medieval times; it was regarded as a luxurious treat to give to honoured guests, being packed with expensive spices. However, as with the recipe above, some recipes don’t actually contain ginger! It may be implied by the name, or this recipe may be a variant on others that contain ginger. I have chosen to add the ginger.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 ml honey</li>
            <li>500 g bread crumbs (approx)</li>
            <li>½ tbsp cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ tsp white pepper</li>
            <li>Pinch saffron</li>
            <li>1 tbs fresh or powdered ginger (optional)</li>
            <li>½ tsp sandalwood (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Garnish:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Whole cloves</li>
                <li>Branches from a box tree</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Method</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring the honey to a boil and skim off any scum.</li>
            <li>Keeping the pan over very low heat, add the spices except the cinnamon, and sandalwood if using, adjusting the quantities to suit your taste.</li>
            <li>Slowly beat in the bread crumbs. Add just enough bread crumbs to achieve a thick, stiff, well-blended mass You will know you have enough bread crumbs when the mix becomes hard to stir; this may take more or less bread crumbs than the amount specified.</li>
            <li>Remove from the heat and turn the mixture onto a lightly greased shallow baking tray. Press the gingerbread evenly out into the pan.</li>
            <li>Leave to cool in the fridge. When cool, sprinkle with cinnamon.</li>
            <li>Gently ease the ginger bread out of the tray, and cut into small squares.</li>
            <li>To serve, garnish with sprigs of box, and whole cloves.</li>
        </ol>
